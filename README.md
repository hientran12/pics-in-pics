# picture-in-picture
Picture-in-Picture made it possible for a user to pop a video out into a small floating window that stays above all others, so that they can keep watching while doing other things. Itâ€™s an idea that came from TV, where, for example, you might want to keep watching your Popular Sporting Event even as you browse the guide or even other channels.
